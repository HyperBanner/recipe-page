## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- <table>

### What I learned

I learned how hard it is to add responsiveness to certain elements if you don't plan ahead, forcing me to use some sketch workaround. I got there, but it wasn't easy. I learned that there are a lot of answers to really specific questions on the web, and I was able to google away 90% of my problems.
I also learned about "calc()", and other nifty things, namely the "::marker" pseudo-element. I believe this solidified my CSS skills further than the last project I did for [Frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

### Continued development

There's probably some code inconsistency I overlooked here and there, but mostly I feel like it was me shooting myself in the foot for not designing the page "mobile-first, desktop-second", because half my time was spent trying to figure out how to properly set up responsiveness.
One thing I do want to explicitly learn is: How to do a table-like layout without using <table>. There's got to be a better or more "modern" way.

### Useful resources

Nothing particularly groundbreaking gleamed, besides a quick google search or two. If I would've found a better way to do tables, I would've put it here.
